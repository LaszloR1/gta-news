This week brings seven new arenas to the cutting-edge game mode across some of the city’s most notorious landmarks — and they’re paying out 3X GTA$ & RP all week long.<br /><br />Plus, play a round of Deadline and purchase the Shotaro before June 30th to receive a GTA$750,000 rebate (available within 72 hours of logging in after June 30th).",
