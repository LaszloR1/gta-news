Case in point: Hasta La Vista, the Adversary Mode wherein the cyclists must do their best to outpace, outmaneuver and somehow escape a pursuing truck — or two. Survive, or end up a smear on the side of the road. <br /><br />Whatever the outcome, all players who complete a round of Hasta La Vista will earn triple GTA$ and RP, all week long.",
