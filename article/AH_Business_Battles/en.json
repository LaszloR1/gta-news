Business Battles are a unique opportunity to take possession of a little extra product and convert it to hard cash â€“ or, if you have a Nightclub Warehouse, just add it to your stockpile. Beware though, because every cutthroat and goon in the city will have exactly the same opportunity, and incentives to cooperate are thin on the ground.",
