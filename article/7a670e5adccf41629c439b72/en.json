Win or lose, you’re walking away with 2X GTA and RP.<br /><br />Every now and then, your competitive urge will win out. Whether it’s skimming across the surface of the Pacific or threading an aircraft through the wind turbines and electrical wire of Blaine County, Air Races and Sea Races are both doling out double for the next seven days — a little bit of something for everyone.",
