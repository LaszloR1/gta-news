You’ll be assigned a reinforced Brute Stockade and a delivery point, but expect trouble on the road. The more damage your vehicle takes, the less you’ll earn, and if it’s destroyed the job’s a bust.  <br /><br />Complete three Safeguard deliveries to complete the Weekly Challenge and get the Hands On Car Wash Overalls, plus earn a boosted bonus of GTA$200,000. <br /><br /><br />",
