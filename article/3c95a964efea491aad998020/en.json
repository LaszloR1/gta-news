Whether you’re running home deliveries, dodging police ambushes, or going stealth mode, the goal in Acid Lab Sell Missions stays the same: drop off product, avoid getting caught, and earn 1.5X GTA$ and RP all week long.<br /><br />Speaking of illicit economics, make sure production keeps up with demand. Help Mutt stay stocked by engaging in Acid Lab Resupply Missions this week to earn Double Supplies.",
