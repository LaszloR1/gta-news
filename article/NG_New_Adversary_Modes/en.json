With each lap, the roles are reversed.<br /> <br />Offense Defense - A Runner collecting checkpoints in a lowrider must work together with their Blocker, who protects the Runner and takes out opponents for them.<br /> <br />Keep The Pace - Stay above a minimum speed while racing around courses littered with jumps and obstacles. If you slow down too much, youâ€™ll explode.",
