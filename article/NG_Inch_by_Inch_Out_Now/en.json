Two teams fight over possession of the package and attempt to deliver it over each other’s line. When holding the package, you won’t have room for a gun so you’ll be relying on your teammates covering fire for that dash to the line.

Highest score wins.","url":"","image":{"path":"sc/news/NG_Inch_by_Inch_Out_Now/262272_Inch_by_Inch.dds","filesize":262272},"landscape":{"path":"sc/news/NG_Inch_by_Inch_Out_Now/.dds","filesize":2048}}
