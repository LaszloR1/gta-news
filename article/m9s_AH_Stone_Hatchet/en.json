To unlock this new weapon, watch out for a text from Maude Eccles to get started on a series of Bounty Target missions. Once you’ve got your hands on the stone-cold prize, complete a melee kills challenge with the Stone Hatchet to receive a GTA$250,000 reward and to unlock the same weapon in Red Dead Redemption 2.",
