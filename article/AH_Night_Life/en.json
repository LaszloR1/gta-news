There’s work to do: run missions to secure your club’s resources, bag a world-class DJ, and keep a high profile. But while you’re there, you might as well have some fun: tear up the dance floor, trash the VIP area, pass out in the bar, start a fight on the sidewalk – there’s no such thing as bad publicity.",
