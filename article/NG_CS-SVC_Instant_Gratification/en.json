Well, good news for cash-rich, time-poor kingpins across Los Santos: for a special buy-it-now price, you can now have instant access to any vehicle that had to be acquired on a heist. And because you can never have too much of a good thing, the Rhino, Annihilator, Buzzard and the Dubsta 6x6 no longer have rank requirements before purchase either.",
