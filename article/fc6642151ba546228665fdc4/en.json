While it may be a foreign export, its disregard for safety regulations makes it a perfect cultural fit. <br /><br />The Pipistrello is a state-of-the-art supercar with a slender build that belies its beastly performance, and is now available to purchase from Legendary Motorsport or at the Luxury Autos Showroom. <br /><br />It’s also free for GTA+ Members to claim at The Vinewood Car Club through July 31.<br />",
