This covetable model from Grotti’s back catalog is lithe, muscular, and intimidating — like a bodybuilder in a bikini. <br /><br />The Grotti Itali Classic (Sports Classic) is available now to buy from Legendary Motorsport. Imani Tech Missile Lock-On Jammer capabilities for the Itali Classic are also available from the Vehicle Workshop inside your Agency — and in the Mansion Vehicle Workshop if you're a GTA+ Member.",
