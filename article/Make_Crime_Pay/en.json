Each Mission should now pay out a fair reward for the time and effort required, with tougher and longer Missions paying out more than ever. Donâ€™t be tempted to waste time sitting on a Job to earn a higher cash prize: completing more Jobs more quickly will be far more profitable, and much less boring.<br /><br />You can also earn 10, 20 or even 30% more money for completing a Job with more players, so team up with friends for even bigger rewards.",
